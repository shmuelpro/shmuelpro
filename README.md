You are on the web. Surfing. like we did in the 90's  
You come across this github page. why?  
What are you looking for? Really?   

Was it a stray link you clicked that made you land here?  
Or is it something more?

I am Shmuel

I can write about all the technologies I used.   
but how much do I really know.   
What is to know?   
How can we be sure we fully understood what we are working with?  

I am currently working on improving my architecture skills.   
I can write the code but how well can I construct the ideas in advance?   
How can I prepare all the pieces in such a way that not only do they fit with each other
but they are easily replaceable and reusable.   

Anyway its 130am  
goodnight
